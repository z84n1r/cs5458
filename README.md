1)      Evaluating   DTFT.
(a)    Consider   a   sequence   h[n]   such   that   h[n] = 0,   n   > 0   and   h[n]   =   αn   ,   n   ≤   0.
•      What   is   the   DTFT   of h[n]?
•    Explain   what   happens   when   |α| ≤   1.
• Given   that   |H (eȷω   )|ω=0 = 4,   what   is α? 
(b)    A   system   is   described   by   the   difference   equation,

Find   y[n]   when   x[n]   = δ[n].
(c)    In   the   classes   to   come,   we   learn   about   the   “moving   average   filter”   defined   by,

Identify   its   frequency   response   or   the   DTFT.
2)    Recursive   Convolutions.
Let   us   define   a   set   S   =   [0, 1]   and   the   sequence,

Furthermore,   let   us   define,

•      Show   that,

3)    Using   tools   from   Fourier   Analysis,   show   that,

4)    Deriving   Shannon’s   Sampling   Formula.
When   the   basis   functions   {Bk}k,   k   = 0,   ±1,   ±2, · · ·    are   orthogonal,   that   is,
then the   function   in the   span of the basis   functions,   can   be   represented   by   the   expansion,

•      What   is   the   Fourier   Transform   of,

•    Show   that   the   basis   functions   are   orthogonal.
•    Show that when   f   is a bandlimted   function,   the   coeﬀicients   ⟨f,   Bk⟩   are   equivalent   to   the   samples   of f(t).
5)    Fourier   Uncertainty.
Let  We are given that  
•      Verify   that,

•      Verify   that,
